# Foundation feature map

Run `make verify` from the repository root. `scripts/verify.py` drives the built
CLI and independently reads SQLite/JSONL. `internal/event/integration` owns the
JetStream and process-kill mechanics. No online account or installed broker is
required. Each harness launches disposable state, checks readiness, drives the
real boundary, records evidence, and always reaps its processes/removes state.

| Feature | How to reach it | Authoritative entry point | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Help/doctor | `bin/personal-agent -help` | `cmd/personal-agent:run` | Usage; no state created |
| Startup diagnostics | `bin/personal-agent [-config path]` | `agent/sqlite.Store.Diagnostics` | setup_required, null profile, closed ingress; stored identity |
| Diagnostic command | `bin/personal-agent [-config path] status` | `cmd/personal-agent:run` | JSON object, zero exit |
| Configuration | `-config`, `ERII_*` overrides | `config.Load` | Invalid fields/URLs/durations rejected without value echo |
| SQLite bootstrap | Either startup path | `agent/sqlite.Open` | Schema v4, WAL, one Agent, one atomic fresh-bootstrap event |
| Migration safety | Empty, real v1/v2/v3, future schema | `agent/sqlite.migrate` | Prior Agent/config/timestamps, model metadata/snapshots and Outbox/Inbox preserved; future rejected; failed v3/v4 DDL rolls back |
| Model metadata | `bin/personal-agent model add` (stdin JSON), `model list`, `status` | `llm/sqlite.Store.AddProfile/ListProfiles` | New process and SIGKILL/restart preserve profile; unverified/version 1; independent SQLite/canonical JSON readback; ingress stays closed |
| Metadata validation | `model add` | `llm.ProfileInput.Validate`, CLI decoder | Unknown/credential fields, credential-bearing URLs, invalid enums, dangling/mismatched auth and pre-Probe activation rejected without value echo or writes |
| Metadata CAS | Host storage, no CLI update surface | `llm/sqlite.Store.UpdateProfile/UpdateAuthState` | One winner across DB connections; stale CAS and event failures leave metadata/Outbox unchanged; profile edits reset verification |
| Secret references | Trusted Host only; no credential CLI or production backend | `llm.RegisterAuth`, `llm.SecretStore`, `llm/memory` test Fake | Put before metadata; database failure cleans new reference even after cancellation; cleanup failure explicit; DB/WAL/SHM and output exclude credential material |
| Immutable model snapshot | Trusted transaction fixture, no Agent Runs yet | `llm/sqlite.Store.FreezeProfile/Snapshot` | Ready-only, frozen profile version and canonical endpoint hash; no CredentialRef; auth/profile changes preserve snapshot; update/delete/REPLACE rejected; outer transaction rollback removes snapshot/event |
| Provider Bridge | Explicit `-test-bridge success` | `llm/bridge.Open`, `llm/fake.Serve` | Version handshake, long-lived stdio JSON-RPC, sanitized errors, process crash/restart, orderly shutdown/reap |
| Catalog and auth fixtures | `model catalog`; Bridge contracts | `ModelCatalog`, `ProviderAuth` | Candidate catalog and refresh; UI-neutral auth events, continue/refresh/status/logout |
| Capability Probe | `-test-bridge success model test ID` | `llm.Control.Test`, `bridge.Client.Run`, `llm.Prober.Run` | Actual stream, Tool Call/Result continuation, cancellation and clipping; tool-less model rejected; no implicit provider |
| Atomic selection | `-test-bridge success model select ID PROFILE_VERSION CONFIG_VERSION` | `llm.Control.Select`, `llm/sqlite.Store.Select` | Version-bound Probe; profile/config/Outbox rollback; concurrent config CAS; v3 migration preserves auth/profile/snapshot/events |
| Effective readiness | `status`, foreground startup | `agent.EffectiveReadiness`, `llm.Control.Available` | Explicit test injection required after restart; absent/invalid profiles, credentials and incompatible Bridge close ingress; ready profile survives SIGKILL/restart |
| Cancelled setup | `model cancel` | CLI read-only diagnostics path | setup_required and identical SQLite dump; no default provider |
| Generation contract | Bridge tests repeated by `make verify` | `LLMProvider.Generate/Continue/Cancel/Dispose` | Sequence dedup/drift/gaps, one completion, immutable snapshot/session identity, partial-crash rejection, received completion before EOF, clipping and bounded errors |
| Stalled Bridge and pre-ack cancellation | Bridge transport regressions repeated by `make verify` | `bridge.Client.exchange/write/cancelGeneration` | Real subprocess stops reading 512 KiB request; caller/write-admission deadlines and forced Close remain bounded; cancellation before start/continuation acknowledgement reaches peer; late ack cannot revive generation |
| Legacy metadata execution limits | `model list`, `model test/select`; v3 migration fixture | `ProfileInput.Validate/ValidateActivation` | Above-limit v3 metadata remains unchanged/readable; one such row does not block listing; Probe/selection/readiness still enforce current Host limits |
| Local observability | Configured `logs/` | `observability.Telemetry.Start` | JSONL logs and correlated startup/database spans |
| Shutdown/restart | SIGTERM/SIGKILL then `status` | `cmd/personal-agent:main` | Stable identity, timestamps, SQLite dump |
| Transactional Outbox | `Store.Transaction` + `event/sqlite.Enqueue` | `event/sqlite.Enqueue` | Domain/event rollback together; unique ID rejects duplicate/drift |
| Event relay | `bin/personal-agent [-config path] relay` | `event.Relay`, `event.Publisher.Flush` | Actual CLI offline launch, broker recovery, same event ID, SQLite publication marker, clean shutdown |
| CloudEvents transport | `EventBus.Publish/Subscribe` | `event/nats.Open`, `event/fake.New` | Shared contract; structured wire JSON/extensions; arbitrary JSON rejected; durable redelivery |
| Transactional Inbox | `Store.Events().Handle` | `event/sqlite.Store.Handle` | Domain+Inbox commit before ack; rollback, ack loss, consumer scope, concurrent duplicates |
| Late/out-of-order snapshots | Domain handler on received CloudEvent | `event/sqlite:TestDuplicateLateAndOutOfOrderSnapshots` | New version wins; old epoch/version ignored; duplicates skip effects |
| Process crash recovery | `make verify` fault suite | `event/integration:TestProcessCrashBoundaries` | Seven SIGKILL checkpoints, full SQLite close/reopen, state readback, one handled effect |
| Broker restart | Integration contract suite | `event/integration:TestNATSBrokerRestartPreservesAcceptedUnackedEvent` | Same file store and durable cursor retain accepted/unacked event |

Reports: `evidence/verification.json`, `evidence/models.jsonl`, `evidence/events.json`,
`evidence/relay.json`. `make test-race` separately checks shared-memory access;
SQL uniqueness/transaction and protocol tests prove their respective invariants.
This remains an M0 slice, with no general Durable Replay or exactly-once claim.
