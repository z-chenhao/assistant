# Foundation feature map

Run `make verify` from the repository root. `scripts/verify.py` drives the built
CLI and independently reads SQLite/JSONL. `internal/event/integration` owns the
JetStream and process-kill mechanics. No online account or installed broker is
required. Each harness launches disposable state, checks readiness, drives the
real boundary, records evidence, and always reaps its processes/removes state.

| Feature | How to reach it | Authoritative entry point | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Help/doctor | `bin/personal-agent -help` | `cmd/personal-agent:run` | Usage; no state created |
| Startup diagnostics | `bin/personal-agent [-config path]` | `agent/sqlite.Store.Diagnostics` | setup_required, null profile, closed ingress; stored identity |
| Diagnostic command | `bin/personal-agent [-config path] status` | `cmd/personal-agent:run` | JSON object, zero exit |
| Configuration | `-config`, `ERII_*` overrides | `config.Load` | Invalid fields/URLs/durations rejected without value echo |
| SQLite bootstrap | Either startup path | `agent/sqlite.Open` | Schema v2, WAL, one Agent, one atomic fresh-bootstrap event |
| Migration safety | Empty, real v1, future schema | `agent/sqlite.migrate` | v1 Agent preserved, no synthetic history; future rejected; failed DDL rolls back |
| Local observability | Configured `logs/` | `observability.Telemetry.Start` | JSONL logs and correlated startup/database spans |
| Shutdown/restart | SIGTERM/SIGKILL then `status` | `cmd/personal-agent:main` | Stable identity, timestamps, SQLite dump |
| Transactional Outbox | `Store.Transaction` + `event/sqlite.Enqueue` | `event/sqlite.Enqueue` | Domain/event rollback together; unique ID rejects duplicate/drift |
| Event relay | `bin/personal-agent [-config path] relay` | `event.Relay`, `event.Publisher.Flush` | Actual CLI offline launch, broker recovery, same event ID, SQLite publication marker, clean shutdown |
| CloudEvents transport | `EventBus.Publish/Subscribe` | `event/nats.Open`, `event/fake.New` | Shared contract; structured wire JSON/extensions; arbitrary JSON rejected; durable redelivery |
| Transactional Inbox | `Store.Events().Handle` | `event/sqlite.Store.Handle` | Domain+Inbox commit before ack; rollback, ack loss, consumer scope, concurrent duplicates |
| Late/out-of-order snapshots | Domain handler on received CloudEvent | `event/sqlite:TestDuplicateLateAndOutOfOrderSnapshots` | New version wins; old epoch/version ignored; duplicates skip effects |
| Process crash recovery | `make verify` fault suite | `event/integration:TestProcessCrashBoundaries` | Seven SIGKILL checkpoints, full SQLite close/reopen, state readback, one handled effect |
| Broker restart | Integration contract suite | `event/integration:TestNATSBrokerRestartPreservesAcceptedUnackedEvent` | Same file store and durable cursor retain accepted/unacked event |

Reports: `evidence/verification.json`, `evidence/events.json`,
`evidence/relay.json`. `make test-race` separately checks shared-memory access;
SQL uniqueness/transaction and protocol tests prove their respective invariants.
This remains an M0 slice, with no general Durable Replay or exactly-once claim.
