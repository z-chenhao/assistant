### F-027 · 配置型 macOS Computer Use

**需求**：Agent 能在明确配置的隔离 Guest 中观察和操作应用与浏览器，并恢复逻辑 Computer。

**当前实现**：Lume 生命周期、SSH Guest、CuaDriver、AX/截图、受限 Playwright、文件传输与 epoch 已实现。

**边界与剩余工作**：范围是 Apple Silicon macOS + 指定 Guest 环境，不包含 Linux 桌面或安装后自动提供 VM；兼容性需在真实平台复验。

**验收目标**：验证指定平台上的生命周期、观察后动作、过期引用拒绝、传输、审批和中断恢复。

## 如何使用

按指南准备 Lume、专用干净 macOS 基础镜像、Guest 驱动及浏览器，显式配置 Computer 和 JavaScript。

Agent 在 Code Mode 使用 `cua.getState()` 发现资源，再绑定 App/Tab、读取文档和观察后操作。Linux 云环境不能提供该真实桌面路径。

## Computer Use

Configure the [durable Computer](../designs/computer-use.md) and JavaScript runtime. Code Mode
then discovers live Apps, Windows, Browsers and Tabs through the existing three
private Computer bridge Tools. Direct model calls to these Tools are rejected.
There is one Agent Loop and one ToolInvocation/Security/replay pipeline.

```js
const state = await cua.getState();
const app = await cua.getApp("com.example.Editor");
text(await app.documentation());
const observation = await app.getAXStateAndScreenshot();
text(observation.ax.state);
image(observation.screenshot.image);
```

Inventory failures appear by source in `getState().errors`; surviving sources
remain available. `getApp`, `getBrowser` and `getTab` bind existing resources.
`cua.computer.launchApp({app: bundleId})` and `createBrowserTab(browserId, url)`
are explicit mutations. `getApp({windowId})` binds a discovered window when an
App has multiple windows. Window IDs use native process/window identity, so
identical titles remain independently bindable and renaming does not change
the Surface identity. A Tab can be rebound by `{url}` when that URL has one
match. Ambiguous selectors fail rather than choosing an arbitrary target.

### Playwright provisioning

The only delayed Capability is Tab `playwright`. Read `capabilities.list()` before
`get("playwright")`. Its documentation describes CSS locators, bounded navigation
waits, download and chooser upload. Every method creates a normal nested
ToolInvocation. Navigation/reload expires the Capability even at the same URL.
CSS resolution and actionability waits stay scoped to the bound document. A
matching control in a replacement document cannot receive the pending input;
the call fails with `STALE_SURFACE_HANDLE`. CSS may follow element replacement
within the same document, while core ElementRefs remain tied to one DOM node.
There is no evaluate, dynamic import, arbitrary browser endpoint or filesystem
API in the model facade.

Install Node 24.21.0 and this repository's `guest-browser/package-lock.json` in the
clean Guest. Run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` there. The pinned Playwright Core
1.64.1 dependency uses Apache-2.0 and adds no Go dependency or Host runtime.
Place `internal/computer/macosvm/transfer.py` beside Playwright Core's `index.mjs`
as `erii-transfer.py`. Provision one isolated Chromium profile with CDP listening
only on Guest loopback. The adapter binds that existing browser; discovery does
not launch it or attach to a Host user's browser. Add trusted configuration:

```yaml
computer:
  # existing durable Lume/Guest configuration ...
  browser:
    node: /opt/erii/node/bin/node
    module: /opt/erii/browser/node_modules/playwright-core/index.mjs
    port: 9222
```

Absent browser configuration reports no managed Browsers. A configured browser
failure is an Inventory error and does not suppress native Apps or Windows.
The module version is checked before CDP attachment; configuration and bridge
resource versions are frozen in Capability Snapshots. Reprovisioning affects new
Runs; mismatched snapshots fail closed.

### Provisioning

Use Apple Silicon macOS, Lume 0.6.1, a private APFS test store, and a clean,
stopped macOS image with a signed CuaDriver application and pregranted Guest
permissions. The tested combination is documented in [L2 acceptance](../test-plans/product.md).
The operator supplies a dedicated image without personal accounts, API
credentials or user documents. The compatibility exercise's working VM must
have its synthetic projects and exports removed before serving as this base.

The application does not install or supervise Lume. Run its HTTP API explicitly
in the foreground with a separate `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Configure exactly one VM
location, disable telemetry/caching, and keep `vmLocations` last in the pinned
Lume YAML parser:

```yaml
defaultLocationName: "erii"
cacheDirectory: "/ABSOLUTE/OWNED/cache"
cachingEnabled: false
telemetryEnabled: false
vmLocations:
  - name: "erii"
    path: "/ABSOLUTE/OWNED/computer/vms"
```

Use an explicit loopback IP and port. The adapter checks the server's exclusive
storage location, telemetry/caching settings and version before lifecycle work.
HTTP proxies and redirects are disabled. Runtime starts use headless mode with
VNC disabled, no shared Host directories, and Lume's disabled clipboard default.
No default VM store is discovered or adopted.

Initial allocation calls Lume HTTP `clone`, which gives the new logical Computer
its own MAC and machine identifier. A frozen clone marker is durable before
dispatch. The pinned implementation writes the new machine identifier after the
complete directory copy and MAC update; this final postcondition reconciles a
lost HTTP response. A partial clone is never retried or started. Subsequent
checkpoint restores retain this Computer's hardware identity.

Add this advanced configuration to the application's versioned YAML. Keep
`computer.root` separate from application data, coding workspaces, Skills and MCP
working directories. Use a new empty directory with mode `0700`.

```yaml
computer:
  root: /ABSOLUTE/OWNED/computer
  endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:17774
  compatibility:
    provider_version: "0.6.1"
    guest_build: "25F84"
    driver_version: "0.36.0"
    driver_sha256: "54bb23df35ae9a52b6fa7b71e607364d0711bbbf750b9edb006e87b9af586fdd"
    driver_team: "YCK386LBJ7"
    driver_bundle: "com.trycua.driver"
    architecture: arm64
  guest:
    user: lume
    port: 22
    password_ref: env:OWNED_GUEST_PASSWORD
    host_key_sha256: "SHA256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_OWNED_GUEST_ED25519_FINGERPRINT"
  manifest:
    version: 1
    applications: []
    artifact_refs: []
```

JavaScript configuration is also required; see [Code Mode](../designs/codemode.md).
Replace the SSH fingerprint with the dedicated Guest's public Ed25519 key
fingerprint. The transport resolves only the explicit SecretStore reference,
uses password authentication in memory, pins Ed25519, and never consults Host
SSH keys or ssh-agent. The existing pinned `x/crypto` module supplies SSH.
Never put the password itself in YAML, SQLite, command arguments or evidence.
The public seed's test login is suitable only for the isolated L2 fixture.

Prepare the base before opening the configured application:

```sh
bin/erii -config /ABSOLUTE/OWNED/erii.yaml computer prepare-base /ABSOLUTE/OWNED/clean-stopped-vm
bin/erii -config /ABSOLUTE/OWNED/erii.yaml computer status
```

`prepare-base` copies only `disk.img`, `nvram.bin` and `config.json`, holds the
native config lock, rejects a session marker, hashes the unit, and publishes its
ownership marker. It refuses a nonempty destination and symlink paths. This is
an offline operator provisioning command; VM lifecycle requests run through the
accepted Tool pipeline. `computer status` is a read-only operator diagnostic.
